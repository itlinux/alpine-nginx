``I build this because I had hard time finding a container that did have the apps to perform specific tasks within the k8s cluster. ``

I came across a container which was almost all I needed but not quite there. So I build this with what I wanted. 

```List:
bind-tools 
curl 
bash 
iputils
vim 
busybox-extras 
httpie 
jq 
tcpdump 
tcptraceroute 
util-linux 
vim 
openssl 
iperf 
apa$che2-utils
```
